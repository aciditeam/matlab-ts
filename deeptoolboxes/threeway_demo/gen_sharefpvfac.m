% This program uses a factored, conditional RBM with three-way
% interactions to generate data, given labels
%
% The program assumes that the following variables are set externally:
% numframes    -- number of frames to generate
% fr           -- a starting frame from initdata (for initialization)
% labels       -- has numframes rows, 1-"hot" encoding

numGibbs = 100; %number of alternating Gibbs iterations 
initNoise = 0.05;  %sd of Gaussian noise added to initialization

numdims = size(initdata,2);
numlabels = size(labelfeat,1);

%initialize visible layer
visible = zeros(numframes,numdims);
visible(1:n1,:) = initdata(fr:fr+n1-1,:);
%initialize hidden layer
poshidprobs = zeros(numframes,numhid,'single');
hidstates = ones(numframes,numhid,'single');

%initialize
past = zeros(1,nt*numdims);

for tt=n1+1:numframes
  
  %initialize using the last frame + noise
  visible(tt,:) = visible(tt-1,:) + initNoise*randn(1,numdims);
  %past = visible(tt-1,:); %hard-coded to 1 delay tap
  %Easiest way to build past is by a loop
  %Past looks like [ [data time t-nt] ... [data time t-1] ]
  for hh=nt:-1:1 %note reverse order
    past(:,numdims*(nt-hh)+1:numdims*(nt-hh+1)) = visible(tt-hh,:);
    %Cheat and use initdata instead of generated data
    %Note the conversion to the absolute fr scale instead of the relative
    %tt scale
    %past(:,numdims*(nt-hh)+1:numdims*(nt-hh+1)) = initdata(fr+tt-hh-1,:);
  end
  
  %overwrite last past
%   hh=1;
%   past(:,numdims*(nt-hh)+1:numdims*(nt-hh+1)) = visible(tt-hh,:);


  %Input from features & past does not change during Alternating Gibbs 
  %Set these now and leave them
  features = labels(tt,:)*labelfeat;
  
  %inputs to factors (note shared weights)
  yfeat = features*featfac;
  ypast = past*pastfac;  

  %constant term during inference
  %(not dependent on visibles)
  constinf = -(ypast.*yfeat)*hidfacB' - hidbiases;
  
  %constant term during reconstruction
  %(not dependent on hiddens)
  constrecon = (yfeat.*ypast)*visfac' + visbiases;
  
  %MAIN Gibbs sampling loop

  for gg = 1:numGibbs

    yvis = visible(tt,:)*visfac;    
    
    %pass through sigmoid    
    %only part from "undirected" model changes
    poshidprobs(tt,:) = 1./(1 + exp(-(yvis.*yfeat)*hidfac' + constinf));     

    %Activate the hidden units
    hidstates(tt,:) = single(poshidprobs(tt,:) > rand(1,numhid));

    yhid = hidstates(tt,:)*hidfac;
    
    %NEGATIVE PHASE
    %Don't add noise at visibles
    %Note only the "undirected" term changes
    visible(tt,:) = (yfeat.*yhid)*visfac' + constrecon;    
    
%         sfigure(3); imagesc(hidstates'); colormap gray; axis off
%         drawnow;
%     pause(0.5);

  end

  %Now do mean-field
  yhid_ = poshidprobs(tt,:)*hidfac; %smoothed version
