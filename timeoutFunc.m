function varargout = timeoutFunc(f, t, varargin)
%
% [out1, out2, ...] = timeout(f, t, arg1, arg2, ...)
%
% INPUTS:
%    f    : function or function handle.
%    t    : length of time before timeout
%    arg1 : first input to f
%    ...
%    argN : Nth input to f
%
% OUTPUTS:
%    out1 : first output from f
%    ...
%    outM : Mth output from f
%
% This function is used to evaluate a function but with a given time
% constraint.  Therefore the example
%
%   [a, b] = timeout(f, 3, X, Y, Z)
%
% is equivalent to evaluating
%
%   [a, b] = f(X, Y, Z)
%
% except that the first call will throw an error if the evaluation does not
% complete before (approximately) 3 seconds.  Note that this function
% relies on the Parallel Computing Toolbox, specifically the functions
% BATCH and WAIT.
%
% If the evaluation contains an error, the traceback will probably contain
% references to these functions and probably others.
